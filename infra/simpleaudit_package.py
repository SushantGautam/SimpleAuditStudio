"""Resolve SimpleAudit engine provenance from the installed package.

The SimpleAudit engine is a normal pip dependency of this project (declared in
``requirements.txt``). Its provenance — the version stamped into every frozen
AuditRun manifest and the optional git commit — is read from the *installed*
package metadata, never configured by hand:

- ``version`` comes from ``importlib.metadata.version("simpleaudit")`` (the
  ``Version`` field of the distribution metadata).
- ``commit`` comes from the PEP 610 ``direct_url.json`` record when the package
  was installed from a VCS source (e.g. ``git+https://...@<ref>``). When it was
  installed from a registry wheel/sdist there is no commit, so this is ``None``.

This module is deliberately import-safe: importing it never imports the engine
and never raises. Callers get ``None`` for fields they cannot determine, which
keeps web-only and test environments (where the engine may not be installed)
working.

Development override
--------------------
For local development against an unmerged engine revision, a developer may drop
a ``simpleaudit-dependency.yaml`` at the project root containing ONLY a
``git_ref:`` key::

    git_ref: d19785f0d9d3bd9cb647b519c08661cbab0c4d60

That value is recorded as the run's ``git_commit`` provenance instead of the
installed package's commit. It is a dev convenience only — production relies on
the committed ``requirements.txt`` pin, and the file is gitignored so it can
never leak into a deployment. There is intentionally no ``path:`` override: the
engine is always consumed as an installed package.
